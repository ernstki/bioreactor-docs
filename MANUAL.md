## Introduction
In today's fast paced world, it can be very challenging to network and meet
new people with similar interests and experiences with technology and
development. Developers may be working on very similar projects or may need
assistance with a project, but have no readily accessible means of meeting
other developers with knowledge and experience or find mentors to help further
refine their own skills.

### Scope
The Bioreactor project will initially target 

### Objectives and Success Criteria
The objectives of the project are to:

* Facilitate communication between users based on projects/ideas
  that rank according to their provided interests profile
* Create a system of peer rating and credentialing which can be used to
  certify individuals' skills and evaluate their suitability for collaboration
* Provide basic groupware functions such as email discussion lists or live chat*

\*_Stretch goals: only if primary functionality is implemented ahead of
    schedule_

## Current System

There is currently no single industry-leading service which provides a
collaborative platform for creators seeking to recruit others to help with
their projects. 

## Proposed System

### Overview
We believe Bioreactor will differentiate itself on the market by providing
a unified platform for ...

### Functional Requirements

Cum Epicuro autem hoc plus estnegotii, quod e duplici genere voluptatis
coniunctus est, quodqueet ipse et amici eius etmulti postea defensores eius

* as few possible clicks/taps as possible
* Profile images should be encouraged to professional

#### Reliability
* Project should be hosted on a scalable infrastructure which anticipates

  inform developers of problems and downtime

#### Performance
* Search functionality should be prominent and easily accessible in both the
  Android and web interfaces
* The mobile application should be easily navigated with the fewest clicks
  possible
* The web front end should utilize Ajax to push page "fragments" rather
  than whole page updates, and maximize the use of browser cache and HTML5
  offline storage APIs to improve responsiveness and resiliency to periods
  of disconnected use

#### Supportability
