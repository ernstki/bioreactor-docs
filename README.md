# Bioreactor User Documentation

User-oriented documentation for the [Bioreactor][1] bioinformatics analysis web
server framework.

## CS5002 Assignment #3: User Manual (Due Feb 1)

Create web pages for a user guide or manual, so that users have a "howto"
resource to refer to for your project. You should submit a public link to your
project’s user guide or manual.  The goal of this assignment is to give
assistance to people using your particular project or system. Most user guides
contain both written explanations and associated images, e.g. screenshots. The
language used in the guide should match to the level of the intended or typical
user. Jargon should be kept to a minimum or explained thoroughly. Your pages
should include an FAQ, which is helpful to address common questions or concerns
of users. 

Here are some model user guides that you may consider emulating:

* Wikipedia – [Getting Started](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Getting_started)
* Mozilla [Firefox User Guide](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/central/)
* Git – [Getting Started Guide](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started)

Greg Franko.

The [PDF version][6] of this document was created with John MacFarlane's
[Pandoc][7] document processing system.
